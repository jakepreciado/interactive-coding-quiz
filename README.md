# interactive-coding-quiz
This project is an interactive coding quiz that leverages JavaScript logic to dynamically modify the HTML page, interact with user input, and store data persistently in the user's browser. It provides users with an opportunity to evaluate their understanding of JavaScript and allows them to save their scores to track their progress and compete with others.
