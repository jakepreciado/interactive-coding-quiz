# interactive-coding-quiz
This project is an interactive coding quiz that uses logic from JavaScript to dynamically update the 
html page, receive and respond to user input, and stores persistent data locally to the browser. Users can 
test their knowledge of the script language and save their scores for progress checking, and competing with 
their peers!
